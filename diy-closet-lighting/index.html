<p><strong>Diy Closet Lighting</strong>, This is trickier than it first appears because of the design of the closet. The light boxes within the �mylight.me� system are packed with led bulbs that will provide up to 30,000 hours of light. We start at the wall outlet under the kitchen cabinets, flow through the led driver to convert to 12v power, go through a small hole in the wall, down the inside of the closet, the red wire goes.</p>

<h3 id="easy-closet-or-cubby-lighting-with-christmas-lights-diy">Easy closet or cubby lighting with Christmas lights. DIY</h3><p>Perfect to be placed above the headboard of your bed, this light fixture can be done with the help of basket shaped coffee filters, fairy lights set, and a sheet of hardware cloth. For the lights i chose to use led strips for even lighting. The decorative vases, pullout belt trays and hanging sections give it. The second thing that you can do is install a small switch in your closet. Some lights of course, something controlling the lights and a sensor to tell us when the door(s) open. Exceptional closet organization and storage is all well and good, but without proper lighting, the simple task of finding an article of clothing or a jacket can become a major inconvenience.</p>
